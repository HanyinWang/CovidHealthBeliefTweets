# Understanding COVID-19 Health Beliefs using Tweets

The dataset [Annotation dataset.csv](https://github.com/HanyinWang/CovidHealthBeliefTweets/blob/main/Annotation%20dataset.csv) is manually annotated for construction of health belief model (HBM).

This [code snip](https://github.com/HanyinWang/CovidHealthBeliefTweets/blob/main/classifiers.py) provides the classifiers that used to construct the HBM. The best classifiers with the best parameters are directly used in the classifiers. An example notebook for searching the best architecture and the most suitable parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/HanyinWang/CovidHealthBeliefTweets/blob/main/CV.ipynb).

Our paper _Using tweets to understand how COVID-19 related health beliefs are affected in the age of social media_ is currently under reivew. More information will be added after publication.
